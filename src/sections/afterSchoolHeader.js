                    At the heart of my educational philosophy is a deep commitment to inclusivity and 
                    exploration beyond the traditional classroom. Leveraging 
                    the schoolâ€™s resources, including the library, I create enriching opportunities where 
                    students delve into innovative skills and concepts not typically covered in their daily 
                    curriculum. These programs are designed to ignite curiosity and foster a love for learning 
                    by offering hands-on experiences and real-world applications that make Math and computing 
                    come alive in exciting, unconventional ways.
